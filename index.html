    <h1>Superherous</h1>
    <h3>A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn't. So in order to be a superhero, 
        you need a power that is more exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess, 
        and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds.</h3>

    <h1>Venom</h1>
    <h3>Is a character who appears in comics published by Marvel Comics, usually associated with Spider-Man. 
        Venom first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man # 300 (May 1988). Originally acting as a supervillain, 
        the character eventually became an antihero. Venom is a black alien (in some versions it may be artificial) 
        symbiote, an intelligent alien creature of a sticky, almost liquid form. Like real symbionts, in order to 
        survive, he needs a carrier, usually a person. The union with the symbiote provides its owner with superhuman powers. 
        The fusion of a symbiote with a human generates an entity known as "Venom".
        The symbiote's first known owner was Spider-Man, who eventually abandoned the alien after learning of his
        true evil intentions. Subsequently, the symbiote united with other hosts, in particular with Eddie Brock,
         his second and most famous host, who became the first Venom and the nemesis of Spider-Man . According to the sources of Shch. I. T.,
          he is one of the greatest threats to humanity, along with Magneto, Doctor Doom and the Red Skull. In 2007, the character appeared in Spider-Man 3: The Enemy Reflected as Eddie Brock, played by Grace Topher. In the 2018 film Venom, Venom is also used by Eddie Brock, played by Tom Hardy.
        Journalist Mike Conroy described the character as follows: "What was originally supposed to be a replacement
        for Spider-Man's suit has turned into one of our friendly Marvel neighbor's greatest nightmares." 
        In 2009, Venom was ranked 22nd on IGN's 100 Greatest Comic Book Villains. IGN also ranked Mac Gargan's version 17th on the 50
        Greatest Avengers, [6] while Flash Thompson's incarnation was ranked 27th. Eddie Brock's Venom incarnation was ranked 33rd on Empire's 50 Best Comic Book Characters.
